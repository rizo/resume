\section{\Palatino\bfseries Summary}

I am a computer scientist and software engineer specialized in design and development of large-scale systems for data analysis. My passion lies in applying theoretical research ideas to real world problems to generate value for people and businesses. I have extensive experience in software architecture, functional programming, databases and operating systems. I am also a polyglot programmer with practical knowledge of OCaml, D, C/C++, Haskell, Clojure, Scala, Python, R, SQL, among other languages. I am naturally curious, entrepreneurial and tenacious with a focused discipline in learning while also enjoying teaching and helping others.

\section{\Palatino\bfseries Experience}

\positionx{Senior Data Science Engineer}{Movvo}{Jan 2016--Present}


Was part of the Research \& Development department and worked as a technical lead in numerous analytics-related projects in which I:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Designed, implemented and tested a distributed computation workflow for efficient computation of {\em Key Performance Indicators} which are the core component of the Movvo's business.
  \item Contributed to the modeling and implementation of a {\em PostgreSQL} database used as a backend for the analytics dashboard.
  \item Implemented a simple data storage system in {\em OCaml} that replaced {\em Cassandra} and handled over 10TB of raw data.
  \item Trained several members of my team on functional programming in {\em OCaml}, algorithms design and analysis, advanced system programming and {\em Unix} platforms.
  \item Produced technical documentation and specification for the {\em Key Performance Indicators} of the {\em Analytics Platform}.
  \item Participated in the company planning meetings aiding the executive and management teams to define the future releases of the product.
\end{itemize}

\positionx{Head of Data Analysis}{Movvo}{Dec 2014--Jan 2016}
Responding to the growing needs of the company I led the creation and managed the Data Analysis department. I managed 10 projects within the team composed of very talented computer scientist and developers who created a flexible data oriented product which was successfully delivered to the customers. During this period I:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Designed and implemented a scalable system for data analysis. Used {\em Spark} as a computation engine with {\em Cassandra} connector and {\em Clojure} interface to process raw sensor data.
  \item Introduced functional programming in the company by showing practical benefits of immutability, composability and type safety.
  \item Improved the overall performance of the {\em Analytics Platform} by the average factor of 20x by reimplementing the metrics engine in {\em OCaml}.
  \item Instituted {\em Extreme Programming} agile methodology within the Data Analysis team promoting code review and pair programming.
  \item Provided support and maintenance for the product batch pipeline working closely with the delivery team and project managers.
\end{itemize}

\positionx{Software Developer}{AroundKnowledge}{Dec 2013--Dec 2014}
I joined a hardware startup with a small team of engineers where I made core contributions to the company's {\sl Minimum Viable Product}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Studied the behaviour of {\sf RF} signal and implemented an indoor positioning system that became a key component of the company's business for dozens of clients. Used {\sf R} and {\sf Python} for experiments and {\sf Python/Numpy} for the final implementation.
  \item Worked on a firmware for real-time WiFi scanning and processing that was deployed on thousands of sensor nodes across hundreds of locations. Used {\sf OpenWRT} to build the firmware, the services were implemented in {\sf C} and the communication was done over the {\sf MQTT} protocol.
  \item Started the creation of a distributed infrastructure based on CoreOS and Docker for service management and monitoring. The services were implemented in {\sf Python}, {\sf Go} and {\sf D}.
\end{itemize}


\positionx{Research Assistant}{LIACC (Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science Laboratory)}{May 2009--Nov 2013}
I implemented a visual editor for interactive manipulation and processing of models of computation, like {\em Finite Automata}, {\em Regular Expressions}, {\em Transducers} and {\em Turing Machines}. I used {\em Cocoa} and {\em Objective-C} to build the user interface that supported efficient rendering of graphs with more than 100k nodes, with automatic layout computation. I also created a protocol (in {\em Python} and {\em C} using {\em Nanomsg}) for incremental manipulation of automata by interfacing with the {\em FAdo} processing engine.

\positionx{System Administrator}{UPP Nonprofit Organization}{Apr 2009--Dec 2012}
This position helped me to gain a deep understanding of Unix systems with regards to administration, configuration and security. I single-handedly managed all IT-related tasks at {\em UPP}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Provided administration and support for Debian GNU/Linux systems including server and workstation upgrades, backups and failure monitoring, user account setup and security administration.
  \item Integrated {\em Kerberos} authentication protocol across all the services inside the network.
  \item Configured and managed a distributed data storage system based on {\em OpenAFS} with several hundred video interviews for the {\em Memories of Work} project.
\end{itemize}

\positionx{Independent Consultant}{Ministry of Environmental Protection of Tajikistan}{Jul 2010--Oct 2010}
I consulted for the Ministry of Environmental Protection of Tajikistan on a project presented on the opening day of the National Museum in which I developed an embedded dashboard to control an interactive 3D map. The hardware communication service was written in {\sf C} (and some {\sf Assembly}) and run on {\sf FreeBSD} and the touch user interface was designed with the {\sf Qt4} graphics toolkit in {\sf C++}.

\section{\Palatino\bfseries Skills}
I enjoy studying programming languages, their history and theory, actively promoting strongly-typed functional languages for not forcing me to choose between correctness, performance and simplicity. I have industrial experience with Unix-based operating systems and modern SQL/NoSQL databases. Here is a list of the skills I used in at least one nontrivial project:

\section{\Palatino\bfseries Projects}
\subsection{\href{http://github.com/fold-lang}{\faGithub\bfseries\space Fold Programming Language}}
{\em Fold} is an ongoing effort to build a functional programming language built on top of the {\em OCaml} compiler toolkit inspired by {\em Elixir}, {\em Clojure} and {\em APL}. It is a {\em Lisp} dialect with regular user-friendly syntax featuring powerful metaprogramming primitives (inspired by {\em D}). It is particularly well suited for designing DSLs because of its dynamic and flexible parser.

\subsection{\href{http://github.com/rizo/dataflow}{\faGithub\bfseries\space Dataflow}}
My personal research of flow-based programming led me to discover the complexities and trade-offs involved in diverse streaming models, such as {\em iteratees}, {\em coroutine generators}, Haskell's {\em pipes}, Clojure's {\em transducers}, {\em etc}. My goal with {\em Dataflow} is to create a functional and secure streaming abstraction for efficient data processing in {\em OCaml} and {\em Fold}.

\subsection{\bfseries Swarmsence}
I co-founded a working group whose mission is to build a platform for agriculture that enables metric analysis and provides actionable insights based on continuous crop monitoring via a dashboard. I developed an embedded service suite for a {\em Raspberry Pi} in {\em C} and {\em OCaml} that interfaced with {\em ZeroMQ}, stored data messages from a local {\em 6LoWPAN} network with sensor nodes into a {\em SQLite} database and exposed the historical and real-time data for filtering over a {\em HTTP} and {\em WebSocket} interfaces.
